## Test Results

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Current test results:
✓ tests/actions/registry-servers.test.ts (48 tests + 1 skipped)
✓ tests/actions/community-servers.test.ts (15 tests)
✓ tests/api/search.test.ts (7 tests)
✓ tests/demo.test.ts (8 tests)

Total: 78 tests passing + 1 skipped
```

## Testing Approach

### 1. **Unit Testing Focus**
Due to vitest module mocking limitations with server actions, we focused on:
- Testing pure functions and validation logic
- Testing transformation and utility functions
- Testing individual pieces of functionality
- Avoiding complex module-level mocking

### 2. **Mock Data Strategy**
Created comprehensive mock data covering:
- All user roles (regular user, admin)
- All server types (STDIO, SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- All package registries (npm, docker, pypi)
- All server states (local, community, registry, claimed)
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### 3. **Test Organization**
```
tests/
├── actions/          # Server action tests
├── api/             # API route tests
├── utils/           # Test utilities and mocks
└── demo.test.ts     # Infrastructure verification
```

## Pending Tests (Future Implementation)

### Integration Tests
1. **Wizard Flow Integration**
   - Complete flow from GitHub URL to registry submission
   - Multi-step wizard navigation
   - Error handling between steps

2. **Claim Flow Integration**
   - Community server claiming process
   - GitHub ownership verification flow
   - Registry publication after claiming

### E2E Tests
1. **User Journey: Add to Registry**
   - Login → Add Server → Fill Wizard → Submit → Verify

2. **User Journey: Claim Community Server**
   - Browse Community → Claim → Verify Ownership → Publish

3. **User Journey: Search and Install**
   - Search → Filter → View Details → Install

## Key Testing Insights

### 1. **Module Mocking Challenges**
- Vitest hoists `vi.mock()` calls, preventing access to variables
- Solution: Focus on testing logic without complex mocking
- Alternative: Use dependency injection patterns for better testability

### 2. **Validation Testing Success**
- Zod schema validation tests are straightforward and valuable
- Cover edge cases and invalid inputs effectively
- Provide good documentation of expected data shapes

### 3. **Transformation Logic Testing**
- Testing data transformation functions provides high value
- Ensures consistency between different data sources
- Easy to test without complex setup

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**
- Continue using validation tests for new schemas
- Add tests for any new utility functions
- Test transformation logic separately from API routes

### 2. **Future Improvements**
- Consider using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Implement visual regression tests for UI components
- Add performance benchmarks for search operations
- Create fixture data for consistent testing

### 3. **Testing Best Practices**
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Maintain test data in centralized mocks
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline

## Recent Updates (2025-07-11)

### Comprehensive Registry Server Tests Added
- Expanded registry-servers.test.ts from 6 tests to 48 tests (+ 1 skipped)
- Added complete test coverage for all exported functions:
  - `checkUserGitHubConnection` - 5 tests covering all scenarios
  - `fetchRegistryServer` - 3 tests for registry API interactions
  - `importRegistryServer` - 4 tests for server import flow
  - `publishClaimedServer` - 7 tests for publishing claimed servers
  - `claimServer` - 6 tests for server claiming process
  - `getClaimableServers` - 3 tests for fetching claimable servers
  - `submitWizardToRegistry` - 14 tests covering all wizard submission flows
- Improved mock setup with proper dependency injection
- Added comprehensive error scenario testing
- One test skipped due to complex NextAuth flow interaction (documented with TODO)

## Conclusion

The testing implementation provides a solid foundation for the registry features. With the recent expansion, we now have comprehensive test coverage for all registry server actions, significantly improving confidence in the codebase. While we encountered challenges with complex mocking (particularly for the NextAuth flow), the chosen approach of testing individual pieces of functionality ensures good coverage of critical business logic. The test utilities and mock data created will facilitate future test development as the application grows.
