# Plugged.in Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing implementation for Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing Strategy for the Plugged.in registry features.

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Completed Tests

#### 1. **Test Utilities and Mocks** (`tests/utils/`)
- **test-helpers.ts**: Common test utilities and helpers
  - Mock session creation
  - Mock authentication helpers
  - Assertion helpers (`expectSuccess`, `expectError`)
  - Mock request/response builders
  - Test setup utilities

- **mocks.ts**: Comprehensive mock data
  - Mock users, projects, profiles
  - Mock MCP servers (STDIO, SSE, Streamable)
  - Mock shared/community servers
  - Mock registry servers
  - Mock wizard data for all package types (npm, docker, pypi)
  - Mock GitHub API responses
  - Mock registry API responses

#### 2. **Registry Server Actions Tests** (`tests/actions/registry-servers.test.ts`)
Tests for `verifyGitHubOwnership` function:
- ✅ Verify ownership for valid repository
- ✅ Reject invalid GitHub URL format
- ✅ Handle authentication failures
- ✅ Reject if user does not own the repository
- ✅ Verify ownership for organization repository
- ✅ Handle network errors gracefully

#### 3. **Community Server Actions Tests** (`tests/actions/community-servers.test.ts`)
Tests for community server validation:
- ✅ Validate community server creation schema
- ✅ Validate claim server schema
- ✅ Validate server type enums
- ✅ Validate UUID formats
- ✅ Validate GitHub repository URLs
- ✅ Package info extraction for npm, docker, pypi
- ✅ Handle fallback cases

#### 4. **Search API Tests** (`tests/api/search.test.ts`)
Tests for search functionality:
- ✅ Pagination logic
- ✅ Search query parameter building
- ✅ Registry server transformation
- ✅ Community server transformation
- ✅ Filter parameter handling
- ✅ Sort parameter handling

## Test Results

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Current test results:
✓ tests/actions/registry-servers.test.ts (6 tests)
✓ tests/actions/community-servers.test.ts (15 tests)
✓ tests/api/search.test.ts (7 tests)
✓ tests/demo.test.ts (8 tests)

Total: 36 tests passing
```

## Testing Approach

### 1. **Unit Testing Focus**
Due to vitest module mocking limitations with server actions, we focused on:
- Testing pure functions and validation logic
- Testing transformation and utility functions
- Testing individual pieces of functionality
- Avoiding complex module-level mocking

### 2. **Mock Data Strategy**
Created comprehensive mock data covering:
- All user roles (regular user, admin)
- All server types (STDIO, SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- All package registries (npm, docker, pypi)
- All server states (local, community, registry, claimed)
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### 3. **Test Organization**
```
tests/
├── actions/          # Server action tests
├── api/             # API route tests
├── utils/           # Test utilities and mocks
└── demo.test.ts     # Infrastructure verification
```

## Pending Tests (Future Implementation)

### Integration Tests
1. **Wizard Flow Integration**
   - Complete flow from GitHub URL to registry submission
   - Multi-step wizard navigation
   - Error handling between steps

2. **Claim Flow Integration**
   - Community server claiming process
   - GitHub ownership verification flow
   - Registry publication after claiming

### E2E Tests
1. **User Journey: Add to Registry**
   - Login → Add Server → Fill Wizard → Submit → Verify

2. **User Journey: Claim Community Server**
   - Browse Community → Claim → Verify Ownership → Publish

3. **User Journey: Search and Install**
   - Search → Filter → View Details → Install

## Key Testing Insights

### 1. **Module Mocking Challenges**
- Vitest hoists `vi.mock()` calls, preventing access to variables
- Solution: Focus on testing logic without complex mocking
- Alternative: Use dependency injection patterns for better testability

### 2. **Validation Testing Success**
- Zod schema validation tests are straightforward and valuable
- Cover edge cases and invalid inputs effectively
- Provide good documentation of expected data shapes

### 3. **Transformation Logic Testing**
- Testing data transformation functions provides high value
- Ensures consistency between different data sources
- Easy to test without complex setup

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**
- Continue using validation tests for new schemas
- Add tests for any new utility functions
- Test transformation logic separately from API routes

### 2. **Future Improvements**
- Consider using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Implement visual regression tests for UI components
- Add performance benchmarks for search operations
- Create fixture data for consistent testing

### 3. **Testing Best Practices**
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Maintain test data in centralized mocks
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The testing implementation provides a solid foundation for the registry features. While we encountered challenges with complex mocking, the chosen approach of testing individual pieces of functionality ensures good coverage of critical business logic. The test utilities and mock data created will facilitate future test development as the application grows.
