# Contributing to Plugged.in - Building the Future of AI Data Exchanges

Welcome to the plugged.in community! You're not just contributing code - you're building the infrastructure that will define how humanity interacts with AI. Every line of code, every bug report, and every idea brings us closer to a world where AI enhances human capability without compromising autonomy.

## Why We Build

Plugged.in exists because we believe in a fundamental principle: **Your AI, Your Data, Your Control**. We're creating the crossroads where AI models and human intentions meet, ensuring that as AI becomes more powerful, humans become more empowered.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Vision

Before diving into code, understand what we're building:

- Read our [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) to see where we're heading
- Read our [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) to understand the project architecture
- Try the platform at [plugged.in](https://plugged.in) to experience the "what"

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/VeriTeknik/pluggedin-app
cd pluggedin-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Generate encryption key
pnpm generate-encryption-key

# Set up database
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate

# Start the development environment
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## Architecture Overview

Plugged.in consists of interconnected systems working in harmony:

- **Web App (Next.js)**: The control center for AI orchestration
- **MCP Proxy (TypeScript)**: The intelligent router for AI data flows
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: The source of truth for configurations
- **Cache (Redis)**: The speed layer for real-time operations

### Contribution Process

1. **Find an Issue**
   - Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/VeriTeknik/pluggedin-app/issues)
   - Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
   - Or propose your own idea!

2. **Discuss First**
   - Comment on the issue or create a new one
   - Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pluggedin) for real-time discussion
   - Get alignment before major work

3. **Code with Purpose**
   ```typescript
   // Every function should answer: How does this empower users?
   async function enableUserControl() {
     // Your code here
   }
   ```

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Unit tests for logic
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - E2E tests for critical paths
   - Manual testing for UX

5. **Submit with Pride**
   - Clear PR description explaining the "why"
   - Link to related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Add documentation updates

## Code Standards

We believe in code that's as elegant as the future we're building:

- **TypeScript First**: Type safety prevents runtime surprises
- **Functional Patterns**: Prefer pure functions and immutability
- **Clear Naming**: Code should read like documentation
- **Performance Matters**: Every millisecond counts at scale
- **Security by Default**: Never trust, always verify
- **Internationalization**: Support all 6 languages (en, tr, zh, hi, ja, nl)

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Tests should survive refactoring
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Test actual user workflows
- **Edge Cases Matter**: AI interactions can be unpredictable
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure we scale gracefully

### Key Development Patterns

#### Server Actions
```typescript
'use server';

export async function serverAction(params) {
  try {
    // Validate with Zod
    const validated = schema.parse(params);
    // Business logic
    const result = await businessLogic(validated);
    // Return success
    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    // Standardized error handling
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error' 
    };
  }
}
```

#### Internationalization
```typescript
// Always use translations
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export function Component() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <h1>{t('welcome.title')}</h1>;
}
```
