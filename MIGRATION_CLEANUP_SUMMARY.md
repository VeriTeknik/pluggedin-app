# Migration Cleanup Summary

## What was done:

1. **Fixed Migration Errors**: 
   - Updated `0049_graceful_guardsmen.sql` to use `IF EXISTS` clauses for all DROP operations
   - This allows the migration to run successfully even if columns/constraints don't exist

2. **Consolidated Duplicate Migrations**:
   - Moved duplicate migration files to `drizzle/duplicates_backup/` directory
   - These files were not in the migration journal and were causing conflicts
   
   Files moved:
   - 0032_release_notes.sql
   - 0034_fix_system_logs_source.sql
   - 0035_add_system_logs_source_column.sql
   - 0036_fix_system_logs_table.sql
   - 0042_create_mcp_activity.sql
   - 0045_password_reset_tokens.sql
   - 0046_active_profile_fk.sql
   - 0047_tools_table.sql
   - 0048_add_profile_capabilities.sql
   - 0052_lame_invaders.sql
   - 0053_missing_fk_constraint.sql
   - 0054_plain_harrier.sql

3. **Current State**:
   - All migrations are now properly numbered from 0000 to 0049
   - No duplicate migration numbers exist
   - The embedded chat migration (0049_graceful_guardsmen.sql) has been successfully applied
   - The migration journal is in sync with the file system

## For Merging to Main:

The branch is now ready to merge. The embedded chat feature includes:
- Database schema for all chat-related tables
- Backend infrastructure with API endpoints
- Frontend UI for configuration
- API key authentication system
- All migrations are properly consolidated

## Note:
The `drizzle/duplicates_backup/` directory can be deleted after confirming the merge is successful.
