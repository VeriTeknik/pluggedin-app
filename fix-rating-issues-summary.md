# Rating System Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Feedback not appearing in Elasticsearch feedback index**
   - Fixed by including comments in the rating submission to the registry VP endpoint
   - Previously comments were sent separately to analytics API

2. **Ratings not visible on /search page**
   - The display is already implemented correctly in `UnifiedServerCard`
   - Issue might be registry propagation delay or caching
   - Added proper refresh callback after rating submission

3. **No duplicate rating prevention**
   - Implemented client-side checking before showing rating dialog
   - Added local rating tracking table for duplicate prevention
   - Updated rating dialog to show "Update Rating" for existing ratings
   - Pre-populates form with existing rating/comment

## Changes Made

### 1. Registry VP Client Updates
- Added `comment` field to `RatingRequest` interface
- Updated `submitRating` method to accept and send comments
- Comments now included in rating submission payload

### 2. Duplicate Prevention Implementation
- Created `user_ratings` table schema for local tracking
- Added `getUserRating` action to check existing ratings
- Updated `RateServerDialog` to check for existing ratings
- Shows different UI for new vs update ratings
- Added `getUserRatings` method to analytics API client

### 3. Rating Submission Flow
- Comments now sent with ratings in single request
- Local tracking prevents duplicate submissions
- Proper user authentication in all requests
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Migration Required

Run the following to create the user_ratings table:
```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Rating Submission**
   - Rate a server with comment
   - Check console logs for full payload
   - Verify registry receives rating + comment together

2. **Test Duplicate Prevention**
   - Try rating same server again
   - Should see "Update Rating" instead of "Rate"
   - Existing rating/comment should pre-populate

3. **Test Rating Display**
   - Submit rating and wait for refresh
   - Check if rating appears on search page
   - May need to wait for registry propagation

## Remaining Considerations

- The feedback index issue appears to be on the registry side
- Registry may need to process ratings differently for feedback index
- Consider adding manual refresh button if propagation is slow
- May need to implement local rating display while waiting for registry sync
