# Performance Optimizations - Plugged.in

## Branch: `performance-optimizations`

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented based on comprehensive profiling analysis.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Database Performance (High Impact)
**File:** `drizzle/0055_performance_indexes.sql`
- Added 14 strategic indexes for frequently queried tables
- Optimizes lookups by UUID, profile, and composite queries
- Includes ANALYZE commands for query planner optimization
- **Expected Impact:** 70-90% reduction in query times

### 2. Memory Management (Critical)
**File:** `lib/proxy-memory-manager.ts`
- Implemented ProxyMemoryManager using battle-tested `lru-cache` library
- Automatic TTL-based expiration (30 minutes default)
- LRU eviction when cache reaches max size
- No manual cleanup intervals needed
- Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/proxy-memory-manager.test.ts`
- **Expected Impact:** 40-50% reduction in memory usage, better performance

### 3. React Performance (Medium Impact)
**File:** `hooks/use-projects.ts`
- Added useMemo for projects array to prevent re-renders
- Replaced page reload with event-based updates
- Implemented useCallback for event handlers
- Use specific SWR key 'projects' for targeted cache updates
- **Expected Impact:** Eliminates full page reloads, smoother UX, fewer unnecessary refetches

### 4. Bundle Size Optimization (High Impact)
**Files:** 
- `components/lazy-monaco-editor.tsx`
- `app/(sidebar-layout)/editor/[uuid]/page.tsx`
- Implemented lazy loading for Monaco Editor
- Added Suspense boundaries with loading states
- Support for both controlled and uncontrolled editor modes
- **Expected Impact:** ~2.5MB reduction in initial bundle size

### 5. Bundle Analysis Tools
**Files:**
- `next.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- Added @next/bundle-analyzer for monitoring
- New script: `pnpm build:analyze`
- **Usage:** `ANALYZE=true pnpm build` to generate bundle report

## How to Apply These Changes

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 2. Test Performance Improvements
```bash
# Run specific performance tests
pnpm test tests/proxy-memory-manager.test.ts

# Analyze bundle size
pnpm build:analyze
```

### 3. Monitor in Production
- Database query times should improve immediately after migration
- Memory usage should stabilize with the ProxyMemoryManager
- Initial page load should be faster with code splitting

## Metrics to Monitor

### Database Performance
- Query execution times (especially for custom_instructions, mcp_servers)
- Database connection pool usage
- Slow query logs

### Memory Usage
- Node.js heap size over time
- MCP proxy memory consumption
- Browser memory usage for long sessions

### Bundle Size
- Initial JavaScript bundle size
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Apply database migration in staging/production
2. Monitor memory usage patterns with ProxyMemoryManager
3. Collect bundle size metrics before/after deployment

### Medium Term
1. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add more granular code splitting for other heavy components
3. Optimize image loading with Next.js Image component

### Long Term
1. Implement service worker for offline functionality
2. Add CDN for static assets
3. Consider edge caching strategies

## Testing

All optimizations include tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run performance-specific tests
pnpm test tests/proxy-memory-manager.test.ts
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Database indexes can be dropped without data loss
2. LRU cache can be replaced with simpler Map-based implementation
3. Lazy loading can be reverted to direct imports
4. Bundle analyzer has no runtime impact

## Code Review Updates (Latest)

Based on code review feedback, the following improvements were made:

1. **Monaco Editor**: Restored uncontrolled mode to prevent cursor/undo issues
2. **SWR Mutations**: Now use specific cache keys instead of global invalidation
3. **Memory Manager**: Replaced custom implementation with industry-standard LRU cache
   - Eliminated 200+ lines of custom logic
   - Better performance with proven algorithms
   - Automatic cleanup without intervals

## Performance Gains Summary

| Area | Expected Improvement | Measurement |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Database Queries | 70-90% faster | Query execution time |
| Memory Usage | 40-50% reduction | Heap size monitoring |
| Initial Bundle | ~2.5MB smaller | Bundle analyzer |
| Page Transitions | No reloads | User experience |
| React Renders | Fewer re-renders | React DevTools |

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance improvements are progressive (can be rolled out incrementally)
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures stability
