# Unused Files Report

This report identifies files in the codebase that are not being imported or referenced by any other files, excluding `widget.js` as specified by the user.

## Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I found **7 unused files** that can potentially be removed to clean up the project.

## Unused Files

### 1. `components/chat/message-renderer.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Only referenced in documentation (`app/(sidebar-layout)/(container)/embedded-chat/enhanced-features.md`) but not imported anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove if documentation is updated

### 2. `components/workflow/workflow-manager.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Exported from `components/workflow/index.ts` but the index file is not imported anywhere
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

### 3. `components/embedded-chat/chat-capabilities-badges.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

### 4. `components/embedded-chat/chat-capabilities-box.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

### 5. `components/embedded-chat/chat-capabilities-display.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

### 6. `components/embedded-chat/chat-capabilities-inline.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

### 7. `components/embedded-chat/enhanced-task-view.tsx`
- **Status**: Unused
- **Reason**: Not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code
- **Impact**: Safe to remove

## Analysis Methodology

The analysis was performed by:

1. **Exploring the project structure** to understand the layout and file types
2. **Identifying entry points** (pages, components) that serve as starting points for the dependency tree
3. **Mapping dependencies** by searching for import statements using the `@/` alias pattern
4. **Checking references** for each component file to see if it's imported anywhere
5. **Verifying exports** to ensure components exported from index files are actually used

## Recommendations

1. **Review and Remove**: The identified files appear to be safe to remove as they have no dependencies
2. **Update Documentation**: If removing `message-renderer.tsx`, update the documentation that references it
3. **Consider Git History**: Check git history to understand why these files were created and if they might be needed for future features
4. **Test After Removal**: Run the application after removing files to ensure no runtime errors

## Files Excluded from Analysis

- `widget.js` - Explicitly excluded by user request
- Build artifacts (`.next/` directory)
- Node modules
- Configuration files
- Documentation files
- Test files

## Notes

This analysis focused on component files and their usage patterns. There may be additional unused files in other directories (utilities, types, etc.) that could be identified with further analysis.
