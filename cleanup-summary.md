- **Fixed syntax errors** from initial console.log removal attempt
  - Corrected orphaned object literals in 9+ files

## Commits Created

1. `feat: add Zod validation to server actions for security`
2. `fix: remove XSS vulnerabilities by eliminating dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
3. `fix: hide unimplemented features in registry submit step`
4. `feat: consolidate database migrations and add missing languages`
5. `chore: remove console statements from critical MCP files`
6. `fix: resolve syntax errors from console.log removal`

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
- Complete console statement removal (551 remaining)
- Commit remaining 51 modified files

### Medium Priority
- Create reusable dialog components (17 similar patterns identified)
- Extract common dialog logic to reduce duplication

### Low Priority
- Review and remove unused dependencies
- Update README.md with registry v2 features
- Document new features and changes

## Recommendations

1. **Console Statement Removal**: Consider using a proper logging library (winston, pino) with environment-based log levels instead of complete removal
2. **Dialog Components**: Create a shared dialog component library to reduce the 17 similar dialog patterns
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
4. **Dependencies**: Run `npm-check` or similar tool to identify unused dependencies

## Files with Most Console Statements (for future cleanup)
1. app/actions/social.ts - 34 occurrences
2. app/actions/mcp-servers.ts - 20 occurrences  
3. app/actions/mcp-playground.ts - 17 occurrences
4. lib/registry/pluggedin-registry-vp-client.ts - 16 occurrences
5. app/actions/mcp-server-logger.ts - 14 occurrences

## Notes
