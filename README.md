# Plugged.in (formerly MetaTool)


https://plugged.in 

Plugged.in is "The One" MCP to manage all your MCPs. It uses a GUI fullstack app (this repo) and a local MCP proxy to achieve this. (see our latest npm repo [pluggedin-mcp](https://github.com/VeriTeknik/pluggedin-mcp))

A few feature highlights:

- GUI app to manage configurations with dynamic updates when `list_tools`, etc.
- Support ANY MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) because Plugged.in is a MCP server.
- Support prompts, resources, tools under MCP.
- Support multi-workspace: e.g., activate a workspace of DB1 or switch to DB2 in another workspace, preventing polluting context of DB1 to your MCP Client.

The app is also self hostable, free and open source. The differences between this repo and cloud version are:

- You can try how this app works using cloud version but I actually encourage you to self host if you are familiar with docker: it will provide unlimited access with lower latency, full private operations on your end.
- Cloud version adds auth and session contexts
- Cloud version provides server side encryption
- Cloud version tweaks a little bit on serverless hosting
- To use it with Smithery MCP hosting, it requires cloud hosted URL (or you can use ngrok etc.)

Check out demo videos at https://plugged.in/. Here is an overview screenshot.


⚠️ Warning: there are some known compatibility issues on Windows depending on the MCP client implementation, refer to https://github.com/metatool-ai/metatool-app/issues/15 for discussion or workaround solutions.

## Architecture Overview

Note that prompts and resources are also covered similar to tools.

## Installation

To get instantly started with cloud version visit https://metamcp.com/.
To get started with this self hostable version of MetaMCP App, the eastiest way is to clone the repository and use Docker Compose to run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metatool-ai/metatool-app.git
cd metatool-app
cp example.env .env
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then open http://localhost:12005 in your browser to open MetaMCP App.

It is recommended to have npx (node.js based mcp) and uvx (python based mcp) installed globally.
To install uv check: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

You also need a MCP Client to connect to `@metamcp/mcp-server-metamcp`. For example if you are using [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user), the config json may look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PluggedinMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@metamcp/mcp-server-metamcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "METAMCP_API_KEY": "<your api key>",
        "METAMCP_API_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:12005"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Cursor, env vars aren't easy to get typed in so you may use args instead

```bash
npx -y @metamcp/mcp-server-metamcp@latest --metamcp-api-key <your-api-key> --metamcp-api-base-url <base-url>
```

You can get the API key from the MetaMCP App's API Keys page.
