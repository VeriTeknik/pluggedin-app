# Plugged.in Product Context

## Why Plugged.in Exists

Plugged.in addresses a critical need in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem: the management and orchestration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. As AI models become more powerful and specialized, there's an increasing need for tools that can:

1. **Unify Tool Access**: Provide a single point of access to a diverse set of AI model capabilities
2. **Manage Context Isolation**: Prevent context contamination between different workspaces and projects
3. **Simplify Configuration**: Make it easy to set up and manage connections to various MCP servers
4. **Streamline AI Interactions**: Provide consistent interfaces for AI models to access tools and resources

## Problems Plugged.in Solves

### 1. MCP Server Fragmentation

Without Plugged.in, users would need to:
- Manually configure and manage multiple MCP servers
- Handle complex environment setup for each server
- Maintain separate connections for each AI model

Plugged.in consolidates this by providing a unified management interface and proxy service.

### 2. Context Blending

When working with multiple projects or domains:
- Context from one project could bleed into another
- Sensitive information might be exposed across contexts
- Tools configured for one purpose might interfere with others

Plugged.in solves this through workspace isolation.

### 3. Security Concerns

Direct access to MCP servers can create security vulnerabilities:
- Exposure of sensitive API keys or credentials
- Lack of access control between different systems
- Potential for unauthorized access to tools and capabilities

The planned evolution to container-based hosting further enhances security.

## How Plugged.in Should Work

The ideal user experience for Plugged.in is:

1. **Setup**: User creates workspaces for different projects or domains
2. **Configuration**: User adds and configures MCP servers within each workspace
3. **Connection**: MCP clients connect to Plugged.in using a single endpoint and API key
4. **Interaction**: Users interact with tools through a built-in chat interface or via connected MCP clients
5. **Management**: Users can monitor, adjust, and secure their MCP server environments

The transition from proxy-based to native hosting should be seamless, with users benefiting from improved security and isolation without significant workflow changes.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Setup and management should be straightforward, even for complex configurations
2. **Visibility**: Users should have clear visibility into available tools and server status
3. **Control**: Fine-grained control over which tools are available in each context
4. **Security**: Protection of sensitive credentials and secure execution environments
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MCP clients and AI workflows
6. **Performance**: Minimal latency overhead when accessing tools through Plugged.in
