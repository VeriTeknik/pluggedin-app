# Plugged.in Active Context

## Current Focus

We're focused on implementing features that enable easier testing and interaction with MCP servers. The recent work has centered on creating a playground environment where users can test MCP servers through a chat interface using the LangChain integration.

## Recent Changes

### MCP Playground Implementation

We've successfully implemented an MCP Playground feature that allows users to:

1. Select one or multiple MCP servers from their workspace
2. Configure an LLM (OpenAI or Anthropic) for the agent
3. Test the selected MCP servers through a chat interface
4. View detailed debug information about tool execution

The implementation includes:
- Server-side actions for managing MCP server sessions
- Conversion of MCP servers to LangChain tools
- A React-based chat interface
- LLM agent integration using the LangChain ReAct framework

The playground uses the `@h1deya/langchain-mcp-tools` library to convert MCP servers to LangChain tools, creating a seamless experience for testing and development.

### Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Complex Message Handling**: We implemented a robust content processing system that safely handles various message formats from MCP tools, including complex objects with nested structure.
2. **Session Management**: We created a session management system that properly initializes, manages, and cleans up MCP server connections.
3. **User Experience**: We designed an intuitive UI that makes it easy to select servers, configure the LLM, and interact with the agent.

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - Add tables for workspace MCP server instances
   - Add tables for container/process management
   - Add schema for chat conversations and messages

2. **Chat Interface Enhancements**:
   - Add conversation history persistence
   - Implement file upload/download capabilities
   - Add visualization for available tools

3. **Container Management System**:
   - Develop container creation and management capabilities
   - Implement resource allocation and monitoring
   - Set up secure networking between containers

4. **MCP Server Lifecycle Management**:
   - Create processes for starting/stopping MCP servers
   - Implement health monitoring and automatic recovery
   - Develop logging and debugging tools

## Technical Considerations

Current technical challenges that need to be addressed:

1. **Resource Isolation**: Ensuring each workspace's MCP servers are properly isolated
2. **Performance Optimization**: Minimizing latency for tool invocations
3. **Security Boundaries**: Establishing secure boundaries between different workspaces
4. **Scaling Strategy**: Determining how to scale with many concurrent users and servers
5. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling for edge cases in tool execution responses
