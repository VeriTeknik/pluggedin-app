## Current Status

The application is currently operational in proxy mode, allowing users to:
1. Configure MCP servers in workspaces
2. Connect MCP clients to the proxy
3. Use tools from configured MCP servers

The next phase of development will focus on:
1. Implementing the chat interface
2. Building the native MCP server hosting capabilities
3. Creating a seamless transition path from proxy to native hosting

## Known Issues

1. Limited compatibility with some Windows-based MCP clients
2. Lack of built-in visualization for available tools
3. Manual configuration required for each MCP server
4. No built-in rate limiting or resource allocation
