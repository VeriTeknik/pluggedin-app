## Current Status

The application is operational with several key capabilities:
1. Configure MCP servers in workspaces
2. Connect MCP clients to the proxy
3. Use tools from configured MCP servers
4. Test MCP servers through the playground

The MCP Playground is now fully functional, allowing users to:
- Select and test multiple MCP servers together
- Configure various LLM parameters
- Use natural language to test MCP tool capabilities
- View detailed debugging information

The next development phases will focus on:
1. Enhancing the chat interface with additional features
2. Building the native MCP server hosting capabilities
3. Improving error handling and performance optimization

## Known Issues

1. Limited compatibility with some Windows-based MCP clients
2. Lack of built-in visualization for available tools
3. Manual configuration required for each MCP server
4. No built-in rate limiting or resource allocation
5. Complex object responses from some MCP tools require additional handling
