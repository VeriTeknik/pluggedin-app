- Clears both client-side and server-side sessions
- Prevents "Server Components render error" after account deletion
- Ensures clean logout and redirect to login page

**Features:**

#### Settings Page Badge
- Shows which OAuth provider was most recently used for login

- Helps users identify their current login method
- Updates automatically on each login

#### Login Page Badge
- Shows "Last signed in with [Provider] â€¢ X days/hours ago"
- Appears above OAuth login buttons
- Uses localStorage for client-side persistence
- Automatically expires after 30 days
- Helps users remember which SSO they used previously

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `last_used` timestamp column to accounts table
- Updates timestamp on every OAuth login
- Tracks provider usage in localStorage for login page
- Relative time formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")

## Environment Variables Added

```env
# Admin Notifications
ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS=admin@example.com,team@example.com
ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_SEVERITIES=ALERT,CRITICAL

# Welcome Emails
ENABLE_WELCOME_EMAILS=true
EMAIL_FROM=cem@plugged.in
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Cem from Plugged.in

# Email Automation
WELCOME_EMAIL_DELAY_MINUTES=5
FOLLOW_UP_2_DAYS=2
FOLLOW_UP_5_DAYS=5
CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret-for-scheduled-emails
```

## Database Migrations

Run these migrations in order:
1. `drizzle/0056_email_tracking.sql` - Email tracking tables
2. `drizzle/0057_gdpr_cascade_fixes.sql` - GDPR compliance fixes
3. `drizzle/0058_add_last_used_to_accounts.sql` - Last used SSO tracking

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

## API Endpoints

### Process Scheduled Emails
```
POST /api/emails/process-scheduled
Authorization: Bearer {CRON_SECRET}
```
This endpoint should be called by a cron job (recommended: every hour) to process scheduled follow-up emails.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin receives email when new user signs up with email/password
- [ ] Admin receives email when new user signs up with OAuth (Google/GitHub/Twitter)
- [ ] Welcome email is sent immediately after signup
- [ ] User segmentation correctly identifies developer/enterprise/security users
- [ ] Follow-up emails are scheduled for Day 3 and Day 7
- [ ] Account deletion properly logs out user without errors
- [ ] Settings page shows "Last used" badge for most recent OAuth provider
- [ ] Login page shows "Last signed in with" badge
- [ ] GDPR compliance: All user data is deleted on account deletion
- [ ] Email tracking records are created for sent emails

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **OAuth Signup Timing**: Uses setTimeout(1000ms) workaround for OAuth signups since user creation happens after signIn callback
2. **Build Warnings**: Some paths reference `/mcp-servers` (plural) but actual routes use `/mcp-server` (singular)
3. **Cron Job Required**: Follow-up emails require external cron job to call the process endpoint

## Future Improvements

1. Implement email open/click tracking pixels
2. Add email template preview/testing interface
3. Create admin dashboard for email metrics
4. Implement more sophisticated A/B testing
5. Add unsubscribe preferences management
6. Consider using job queue (Bull/BullMQ) for email scheduling
7. Add email bounce handling
8. Implement reply-to email monitoring

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in production
2. Set up cron job for scheduled email processing (every hour recommended)
3. Verify SMTP credentials and email service configuration
4. Run all database migrations before deploying
5. Test email delivery in staging environment first
